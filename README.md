# pyrodiversity
Code to calculate pyrodiversity according to [Steel et al. 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/eprint/RCRFTQ4V7Z2C6SFWWXG3/full). 

Includes demos for [prepping fire perimeters](https://github.com/zacksteel/pyrodiversity/blob/master/code/PerimeterPrep.md) for burn severity estimation in Google Earth Engine, and for [calculating pyrodiversity](https://github.com/zacksteel/pyrodiversity/blob/master/code/YosemiteDemo.md) at the watershed-scale using Yosemite National Park. Pyrodiversity can also be quantifited around sample points or plots. A demo for doing this is coming soon.
